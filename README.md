I was inspired by the article _The Dark Side —— Making war on light pollution_ by David Owen on THE NEW YORKER website. This article is about how light pollution affects us and undermines our valuables from every aspect. It reveals a astounding truth that overwhelming lighting not only threatens humans' security and health(both mental and physical), but also influences our society's well-being, and ruins the whole ecosystem.

Before, I thought that lighting is supposed to be a big convenience for our lives, but living in big cities for many years, I don't remember how long time I haven't seen a starry sky, especially in New York, I can hardly see a completed sky, it's always fragmented. I didn't noticed how much joy I lost until I traveled to some wild areas in the western US and experience the pure darkness and brilliant milky way, which was peaceful and full of spiritual beauty.

People often think dark areas are dangerous, especially in cities, but the harms of lighting are generally underestimated. Hence, I want to visualize the harms of lighting for raising their awareness. from the article, I can see how a system around us is influenced by light pollution, so I tried to design a visualization to show the comprehensive understanding to this issue.

In terms of visualization, I tried to relate the harms of light pollution to what people value, because only when they connect themselves with the issue, only when they realize what they may lose, can they care about the problem and want to solve it. Hence, based on my self experience, I put a dark human under a starry sky in the center of the image, and put a street lamp at the top right. My imagination is when I click the lamp and turn it on, the light will illuminate the human, but also cover him and shed a shadow behind him. Shadow represents "the dark side" of lighting, which means the harms of light pollution, corresponding to the title of the article. In the shadow, I list all the aspects of human values which could be damaged by lighting. If I click them respectively, more details will show below, which tell me what exactly happen.

Because I am not good at coding, I started from photoshop. I hope it is a webpage including the visualization, the article, pictures and some links to useful resources, so I designed the whole webpage in PS, then I used very basic HTML and CSS technique to code the webpage. I wanted to add some interactive effects to the front page, like what I imagined, if I click the lamp at the top right, I can turn it on or off. But I am bad at JS, so I asked one of my classmates to teach me how to do it in a simple way. I think it's successful, so, when you click the white lamp, you can turn it on or off, when it's on, the dark figure of human is illuminated, and shadow appears, so you can read the messages in the shadow and find more details which don't show up when the lamp is off. (please try it)
